After that, I started thinking about and creating a concept to visualize. I came with the idea to make something like a collapsible force layout (https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1062288). The idea is to collect a type of collection and to show the geolocations of it. Each circle will stand for a continent and the size of it will stand for the amount. I've chosen for this style of data visualization, because I think that the interaction fits good in my concept. And it's also scalable. If I would like I could bring the whole collection in map. First I'll bring up the type of object and after the geolocation with the size.
